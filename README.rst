This is a fairly simple user-registration application for Django,
designed to make allowing user signups as painless as possible. It
requires a functional installation of Django 1.4 or newer, but has no
other dependencies.

The original repository for ``django-registration`` is at
https://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/.

As the original author is no longer able to maintain the project, this repository is an attempt to contain the latest fixes and improvements made by everyone else in the community.

For installation instructions, see the file "INSTALL" in this
directory; for instructions on how to use this application, and on
what it provides, see the file "quickstart.rst" in the "docs/"
directory. Full documentation is also available online at
